# Building Scalable Web Applications

Scalability is crucial for modern web applications. Here's what I've learned building production-ready apps.

## Architecture Patterns

### Microservices vs Monolith
- Start with a monolith
- Split into microservices when needed
- Don't over-engineer early

### Database Design
- Use the right database for the job
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching
- MongoDB for flexible schemas

## Performance Tips

```javascript
// Example: Efficient data fetching
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  const cache = await redis.get(`user:${userId}`);
  if (cache) return JSON.parse(cache);
  
  const user = await db.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
  await redis.set(`user:${userId}`, JSON.stringify(user), 'EX', 3600);
  return user;
}
```

## Conclusion

Building scalable applications is about making smart decisions early and planning for growth.
